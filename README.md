# Ninja Kirby  
  
## Description  
A retro-style platform game where you dodge enemies (flames, birds, dudes), or inhale them and shoot a star back at other enemies. Try and reach the exit to progress to the next level!  
  
## Controls  
- Arrow keys to move  
- Space to jump  
- Z to inhale enemies  
  
## Features  
- 5 levels
- 3 enemy types
- levels built with Tiled
- game built with Kaboom.js

## Bugs
- Low FPS causes collisions to go undetected: the player will fall through the floor, or the enemy units will fall off the map. Curious to hear how to improve the collision detection system, and if there are any other ways to optimize the game for better performance.
